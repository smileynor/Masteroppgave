# A scheme for real-time monitoring of power oscillation in a power grid
This is the ** README ** for my project code used during my final master at NTNU.

## Table of Content:
The monitoring system consist of multiple files, each performing it's own task.

## Installation
To run the monitoring system, multiple dependences is needed. The _script_ is written in `Python 2.7`, and used the simulation tools `PSS/E 33` for load flow studies, and `PacDyn 9.8.0 or later` for small-signal studies. The two latter is commersial programs, and a licence need to be obtained. **Note: ** Running the `CollectingData` file also requires access to NordPoolSpot`s server. I'm not eligble to distribute the password, so this has to be _aquired from them personally_.
